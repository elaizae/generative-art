## Concept
After hearing what the project was about and what we were meant to do my mind immediately went to, ‚Äúcreating art together‚Äù.
Everyone that knows me knows that I love working on my own especially because I like to be precise with timing and getting things done. I thought it would be nice for my concept to be lets collaborate on something together and make abstract art.

Besides that also something else about me is that I love to buy clothes. And have so many clothes for that exact reason. So I thought my side of the ‚Äúcollaborative artwork‚Äù could be the colors I like the most from my closet.

My concept in short:
Making something together. A collaborative abstract artwork

## Features


I initially only had clicking as input but as the weeks went on I switched to making my entire artwork for phones. This gave more input possibilities that were more fun to do. Rather than just a basic click or moving your mouse on a desktop.

My artwork uses a phones sensors to detect movement. 

The user can move his or her phone to move a circle and draw a never ending line that bends or goes in the desired direction by moving their phone.
Since Apple removed the possibility of motion to be automatically detected when needed from safari I had to manually set that. (see sources)

The user can click on the screen to change the color of the line.



## Onderzoek & inspiratie

I wanted something minimal at first, I also wanted something that was static but still dynamic and allowed the user to do something interesting.

The coding train on youtube really helped me a lot and inspired me to try things eventhough they werent exactly what i wanted to do. When researching what the possibilities are I really found myself watching more of their videos that neccesary.

## Voortang


### Week-1
- Concept semi figured out. Clothes + collab art
- How I want to achieve it not so sure yet
- I started trying to make shapes statically with p5js. 


### Week-2
- static shapes took awhile but went okay.
Started trying to make shapes randomly generate instead.
Finally know how to give fills and strokes and I understand that swell


### Week-3
Randomly generated shapes working, I tried a lot of different shapes but decided to keep them as rectangles and squares because fabric scraps are usually those shapes.

- trying to give them the colors i want them to have
- Need to start thinking more about how to make the input more interesting

## Week-4
- Finally decided on an input.
- Motion for safari not working properly
Circle not moving on its own only when I tap continuously
Shapes looping endlessly

Felt like I made it a lot harder for myself by switching to mobile device but really did not want to give up

## Week-5
This is where I feel like I was finally actually understanding how js works after figuring out how to stop my shapes from looping.
- shapes stopped looping while circle actually still works.
- Finally drawing circle works perfectly doesn‚Äôt go off screen and changes colors on tap.
Tried putting patterns into shape. Not in my skillset can‚Äôt figure it out
- if I had more time I would definitely try more things to get patterns on my shapes 

## Week-6
Final week, finishing my readme. 
Making sure my code properly works and 
filming video presentation.
